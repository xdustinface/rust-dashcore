# Contributing to rust-dashcore

**Branching model (important)**

Feature work targets the active `v**-dev` branch (development). Submit hotfixes and documentation-only changes to `master` unless maintainers direct otherwise.

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Rust Dash Core
implementation and other Rust Dash-related projects, which are hosted in the
[Rust Dash Core Community](https://github.com/rust-dashcore) on GitHub. These are
mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose
changes to this document in a pull request.

## General

We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug fixes, features, tests, docs, and reviews. This codebase powers Dash protocol libraries (networking, SPV, wallet, FFI). Changes must be reviewed with security and backward‑compatibility in mind.


## Communication

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.
- Use Pull Requests for code changes and design discussions.
- If enabled, GitHub Discussions can host broader design topics.


## Asking questions

Prefer opening a GitHub Discussion (if enabled) or a clearly labeled issue. Provide context, reproduction steps, and what you’ve tried.


## Contribution workflow

We use the standard fork-and-PR model:

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch.
2. Make focused commits; keep diffs minimal and self‑contained.
3. Ensure each commit builds and tests pass to keep `git bisect` meaningful.
4. Cover new functionality with tests and docs where applicable.
5. Open a PR early for feedback; keep the description clear and scoped.

Commits should explain the why and the what. Conventional Commits are encouraged.
PR titles must use one of the following prefixes (enforced by CI):
`build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`.


## Preparing PRs

Active development happens on `v**-dev` branches. Feature work should target the current `v**-dev`. The `master` branch is kept stable; submit hotfixes and documentation changes to `master` unless directed otherwise. All PRs must compile without errors (verified by GitHub CI).

Prerequisites that a PR must satisfy for merging into the `master` branch:
* each commit within a PR should compile and pass unit tests with no errors, with
  relevant feature combinations (including building fuzz tests where applicable);
* the tip of any PR branch must also compile and pass tests with no errors on
  MSRV (see README for current MSRV) and run fuzz tests where applicable;
* contain all necessary tests for the introduced functional (either as a part of
  commits, or, more preferably, as separate commits, so that it's easy to
  reorder them during review and check that the new tests fail without the new
  code);
* include inline docs for newly introduced APIs and pass doc tests;
* be based on the recent tip of the target branch in this repository.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Reviewers may run additional scripts; passing CI is necessary but may not be sufficient for merge. This repo integrates
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to mirror CI locally to run automated checks before commits and pushes.
This catches formatting issues, typos, and linting problems early before CI runs.

#### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install pre-commit (one-time)
pip install pre-commit
# or: brew install pre-commit (macOS)
# or: pipx install pre-commit (isolated install)

# 2. Install git hooks (in this repo)
pre-commit install                    # Runs on every commit
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push  # Runs on every push
```

That's it! Hooks run automatically from now on.

#### What Runs Automatically

**On every commit** (~2-5 seconds):
- `cargo fmt` — Rust code formatting (auto-fixes)
- `typos` — Spell checking in code/comments (auto-fixes)
- `actionlint` — GitHub Actions workflow validation
- File checks — Trailing whitespace, EOF newlines, YAML/JSON/TOML syntax (auto-fixes)

**On git push** (~30-90 seconds additional):
- `cargo clippy` — Strict linting on entire workspace
- `verify-ffi-headers` — Ensures FFI C headers are up to date
- `verify-ffi-docs` — Ensures FFI API documentation is current

**Note:** CI runs the exact same checks, so passing locally = passing in CI.

#### Bash Aliases (Optional)

Add these to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_aliases`:

```bash
# Pre-commit shortcuts
alias checks='pre-commit run --all-files'
alias checks-all='pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push'
alias checks-on='pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push'
alias checks-off='pre-commit uninstall && pre-commit uninstall --hook-type pre-push'
```

**Usage:**
```bash
checks          # Quick check before committing
checks-all      # Full check (same as CI runs)
checks-on       # Enable hooks
checks-off      # Disable hooks
```

#### Bypassing Hooks (When You Need To)

Sometimes you need to bypass checks (e.g., work-in-progress commits, fixing pre-commit itself):

```bash
# Skip commit checks
git commit --no-verify

# Skip push checks
git push --no-verify

# Temporarily disable all hooks
checks-off # or: pre-commit uninstall --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push

# Re-enable later
checks-on  # or: pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

### Peer review

Anyone may review PRs. Start with design and correctness, then style. Maintain respectful, constructive feedback.

### Repository maintainers

Pull request merge requirements:
- All CI checks pass.
- At least one maintainer approval (more may be required for risky changes).
- No unresolved blocking reviews.


## Coding conventions

Follow idiomatic Rust and crate‑local patterns.

### MSRV

The Minimal Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is 1.89; it is enforced by CI. Crates use mixed editions (2021/2024); consult `Cargo.toml` and README for details.

### Naming conventions

Use Rust standards: `UpperCamelCase` for types/traits, `snake_case` for modules/functions/variables, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Prefer descriptive names matching Dash domain concepts.

### Unsafe code

Minimize `unsafe`. When required (especially across FFI boundaries), encapsulate it, document invariants, add tests, and consider Miri/sanitizers.


## Security

This library is NOT suitable for consensus‑critical validation. Always validate inputs from untrusted sources and never log or store private keys. Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories or by contacting the maintainers through a private channel.


## Testing

Testing is a priority. Keep unit tests close to code and use `tests/` for integration. Add fuzz targets under `fuzz/` when appropriate. Use deterministic test vectors and avoid network dependencies unless explicitly required (mark such tests `#[ignore]`).

Overall, have fun and build safely.
