//! Managed core keys account: address pools and key derivation without funds tracking
//!
//! This module contains a lightweight mutable account state that omits the funds
//! bookkeeping (balance, UTXOs, spent outpoints) carried by [`crate::managed_account::ManagedCoreFundsAccount`].
//! It is intended for accounts that exist primarily to derive keys/addresses for
//! special-purpose flows (identity registration, asset locks, masternode provider
//! keys) rather than to hold and spend Dash directly.
