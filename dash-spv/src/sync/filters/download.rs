//! CFilter download and verification logic.
//!
//! This module handles downloading individual compact block filters and verifying
//! them against their corresponding filter headers.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - Filter request queue management
//! - Parallel filter downloads with concurrency limits
//! - Filter verification against CFHeaders
//! - Individual filter header downloads for blocks
//! - Progress tracking and gap detection
